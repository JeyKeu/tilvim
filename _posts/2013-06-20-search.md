title: "Searching again with //"
---

If you've searched for something and want to repeat the search again, just use `//`.

For example, if you run:

    /foo

To search forward for `foo`, and then later on you want to repeat this search, you can simply run:

    //

This also works in substitutions. Say you've searched `/foo` and now want to replace it, there's no need to type `foo` again:

    :%s//bar/g

Will replace all instances of `foo` with `bar` (presuming `/foo` was your last search).
