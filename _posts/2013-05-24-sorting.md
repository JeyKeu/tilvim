title: Sorting a selection
---

Today at work a colleague suggested ordering a hash of key / value pairs alphabetically to provide a bit of order. I agreed and then set about figuring out how to do it in Vim. This was the starting hash:

    {
      "foo" => 2,
      "bar" => 3,
      "baz" => 4,
    }

Expecting some complex solution involving some form of regex searching, Vim surprised me with its built in `sort` functionality. All I did was highlight the keys within the object, and then hit `:sort u`:

    {
      "bar" => 3,
      "baz" => 4,
      "foo" => 2,
    }
    
The `u` means duplicate lines will be removed. `:help sorting` has a great run down of all the options.

The [Vim wiki](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Sort_lines) has some useful other things it can do, too.
