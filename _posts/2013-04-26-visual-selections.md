title: "Extending Visual Selections with 'o'"
---

A quick tip today. If you're selecting some text with Visual Line mode (`V`), you can of course use `j` and `k` to extend this selection up and down. But did you know that you can use `o` while you're in this visual selection to choose which end to extend the selection from?

By hitting `o` you swap your cursor from the top line of your visual selection to the bottom, so you can extend it both ways. This is useful if you need to extend a selection up by a few lines, and then down from the bottom by a couple of lines too.
