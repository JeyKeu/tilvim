title: "Vim's `lcd` command"
---

In Vim you can use `:cd` to change directory across your Vim session. But did you know you can use `lcd` to change directory for the current window?

I find this useful if I'm in one project and need to dig into some code from another. I will open a new tab and then `lcd` into place. Once I'm done I can then delete that tab and in my other window(s) I'm still in the directory I was earlier.

See `:help lcd` for more.
