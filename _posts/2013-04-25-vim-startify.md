Today I found a handy little Vim plugin called [Vim Startify](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-startify).

It adds a small splash screen to the Vim intro screen that shows recently edited folders and also allows you to add bookmarks for files you commonly edit (your `~/.vimrc`, perhaps).

I installed it this morning and so far it's been really useful. It's very basic and doesn't add too much but the ability to hop to recently edited files (I'm forever loading Vim and finding the same file to edit) and also bookmarking files (in particular my Vim and ZSH configuration files).
